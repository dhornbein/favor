		<h1>Favor Solutions Onboarding</h1>
		
		<p>Welcome to the <strong>Favor Solutions Network</strong> we are glad to have you! What follows is a guide to using
			Favor. This guide is for people who are already joined the network. If you would like to join <a
				href="https://calendly.com/deacon-rodda/favor">please contact Deacon</a>.</p>
		
		<h2><strong>Key Terms</strong></h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Favor</strong>: The unit of currency, also called credits.</li>
			<li><strong>Favor Solutions Network</strong>: The organization that runs the Favor Network.</li>
			<li><strong>Favor Ledger</strong>: The public spreadsheet that contains all transactions, this is where you can see your balance.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Exchange</strong>: a row on the Favor Ledger that represents a movement of Favor between accounts.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h1><strong>Overview</strong></h1>
		
		<p>Favor is a complementary currency. That means you can use it just like the dollar bill in your pocket. The only
			difference being that you can only exchange with other people in the network. When you make an
			<strong>exchange</strong> it can be fully in Favor or you can mix Favor with dollars or any other currency you
			desire. To make an exchange you will need to find a willing member to exchange with then mark the exchange down in
			the <strong>Favor Ledger</strong> making sure to provide a 1% transaction fee (rounded up) to the <strong>Favor
				Solutions Network</strong> account. Let&rsquo;s now take a look at the Favor Ledger.</p>
		
		<h2><strong>Quick Start</strong></h2>
		<p>Ready to jump right in and make your first exchange? Let&rsquo;s look at an example to get started.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Caroline </strong>asks <strong>Drew </strong>to help on her Wordpress website. They agree to
				<strong>exchange 300 Favor</strong> (f300). Once the work is done they record the transaction.</li>
			<li>Drew and Caroline both visit the <strong>Favor Ledger</strong>. They name the transaction in column A, add a
				date in column B, then;</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Caroline puts a negative debit in her account&rsquo;s <strong>debit column</strong> (-300) plus a 1%
					transaction fee (-3) for a total -303. <strong>Be sure to always put a negative number in the debit
						column!</strong></li>
				<li>Drew adds the 300 favor to his <strong>credit column</strong> minus a 1% fee (-3) for a total of 297.</li>
				<li>In the same transaction row they add their combined fee (6) to the <strong>Favor SN</strong> credit column
					<br>
					<img src="/img/ledger-example-row.png" alt="">
				</li>
			</ol>
			<li>They then double check the <strong>Total of all Balances in cell B2</strong> and make sure it&rsquo;s still at
				<strong>zero</strong>.

				<br>

				<img src="/img/ledger-example-top.png" alt="">
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>The transaction is now complete.</p>
		
		<h2><strong>The Favor Ledger</strong></h2>

		<p><img src="/img/ledger-example.png" alt=""></p>
		
		<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xyb_-E2oOcLuGqHqx1rV3twOe_tGDtN2JeV-pa11TqM/edit?"><strong>This
					Google Spreadsheet</strong></a> represents the whole of the Favor Network. Let&rsquo;s look at it in detail.
			At the top is data about the Ledger:</p>

		<p><img src="/img/ledger-example-top.png" alt=""></p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Total of all Balances</strong> &mdash; All the transactions added together. It should always equal zero. Once
				you&rsquo;ve added your transactions you&rsquo;ll know something went wrong if it isn&rsquo;t zero.</li>
			<li><strong>Total Transaction Value to Date</strong> &mdash; How many Favors have been exchanged in total.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<img src="/img/ledger-example-people.png" alt="">
		</p>
		
		<p>Further along the top to the right you&rsquo;ll find a column for each member of the network. The top number is that
			member&rsquo;s current balance followed by their credits (Favors they have received) and debits (Favors they have
			spent). Each member controls only their own credit and debit column, more on that in the <strong>Exchanging
				Favor</strong> section.</p>
		
		<p>You&rsquo;ll notice the first member is named <strong>Favor SN</strong>, this is the <strong>Favor Solutions
				Network</strong> account. This is the account that collects your transaction fees. These fees will be used to
			pay folks for future work on the Favor Solutions Network.</p>
		
		<p>Starting at row 5 are the transactions. Each transaction has a name, date, and the credit/debit from 2 or more
			members. Each transaction also incurs a 1% fee from each participant which is subtracted from each credit/debit.
			More on that in the <strong>Exchanging Favor</strong> section.</p>
		
		<h2><strong>Exchanging Favor</strong></h2>
		<p>The process of exchanging Favor mostly happens between Favor Network Members. You will meet people and agree to
			exchange Favor for anything you want. It&rsquo;s up to you to negotiate the terms of the exchange and what will
			constitute it being complete. To add a <strong>transaction</strong> all parties are required to credit/debit their
			own account.</p>
		
		<p>Once the exchange is complete all parties will then mark down the relevant details in a <strong>transaction</strong>.
			Transactions are placed in the Favor Ledger on the next available blank row from the top.</p>
		
		<p>Let&rsquo;s look at a real life example. <strong>Caroline </strong>asks <strong>Drew </strong>for help on her
			Wordpress website. They agree to <strong>exchange 300 Favor</strong> (f300) for the work. Once the work is done they
			record the transaction.</p>
		
		<p>Drew and Caroline both visit the <strong>Favor Ledger</strong>. They name the transaction in column A, add a date in
			column B, then;</p>
		
		<p>Caroline puts a negative debit in her account&rsquo;s <strong>debit column</strong> (-300) plus a 1% transaction fee
			(-3) for a total -303.</p>
		
		<p>Drew adds the 300 favor to his <strong>credit column</strong> minus a 1% fee (-3) for a total of 297</p>
		
		<p>In the same transaction row they add their combined fee (6) to the <strong>Favor SN</strong> credit column</p>
		
		<p>They then double check the <strong>Total of all Balances in cell B2</strong> and make sure it&rsquo;s still at
			<strong>zero</strong>.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Things to look out for:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Be sure to use</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>1% Transaction Fee</h3>
		<p>Each debit or credit in a transaction owes the Favor Solutions Network a 1% fee, rounded to the nearest whole number.
			The minimum Transaction fee is f1. The fee is placed under the <strong>Favor SN</strong> account on the same transaction line.</p>
		
		<p>This fee will be used by the Favor Solutions Network to pay for future work on the network.</p>
		<h2><strong>Favor Solution Network Slack</strong></h2>
		<p>A great way to find additional support or to connect with folks to make exchanges is our Slack channel. When you were
			onboarded you should have been added to the Slack team. Head on over to the <strong>#trading-floor</strong> channel and post your
			offerings and review other&rsquo;s offerings.</p>
