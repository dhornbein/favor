		<h1>Crisis elicits a flow of generosity.</h1>

		<p>That flow of generosity can lead to burnout. Reliance merely on giving often ensures that the systems which we put in place in times of crisis are not sustainable. Impassioned concern causes people to bleed themselves into needful work and provisioning.</p>

		<p>When the crisis is over — or sometimes before — we have to return to the patterns which created the crisis, because there is no more to take from the generous and the altruistic.</p>

		<p>Fire follows flood — follows fire.</p>

		<p>In the wake of the first World War, and as the ripples of the Great Depression began to disturb the European economy even further, a few business owners got together and decided that as long as they had resources and skills to share they wouldn't let any crisis in the governments, the banks, or the outside economy stop them from doing business. They created a simple credit ledger in which all participants started at zero. They began to do business in a currency they simply called the Wir Frank (Our Money). Each member could go a ways into debt, to a degree determined by consensus. This allowed others to be able to sell their offerings. There is no interest on any of the debt, which removes the common incentives to stay out of debt. In the WIR banking system, the idea isn't to accrue money. Money simply exists to make sure that everyone's needs are met — with balance and healthy relating.</p>

		<p>For the first decade, there were only a handful of members in the WIR Bank. Today there are over 62,000 members engaging in the equivalent of over three billion USD in annual trade within the WIR Bank. And, they enjoy the highest degree of financial stability in the world.</p>

		<p>The Favor Solutions Network seeks to bring this elegant set of financial mechanics to Colorado's Front Range, in response to the COVID-19 crisis, and to prevent people suffering from unnecessary economic debilitation from future situations of crisis further down our path.</p>

		<h2>Central Concept</h2>

		<span class="type__aside">This is the part of the idea that should not change <em>ever</em>. The details which need working out are covered below.</span>

		<p>The Favor Solutions Network is a non-capitalist, non-socialist, free-market system. This means that no interest can be charged in service to debt and no appropriation or redistribution of privately held credits will ever occur.</p>

		<p>Within the network, members make purchases of goods and services from each other as they desire. The network takes a 1% network management fee from each party and tracks the exchanges in a centralized ledger. Necessarily, member balances can go — and remain — negative for any period of time without incurring interest.</p>

		<p>The network itself holds an account within the system into which transaction fees are paid.</p>

		<p>The network does not seek to limit mixed currency exchanges, currency arbitrage, or to govern its members pricing policies.</p>

		<p>The above mechanics of the network cannot be changed or used by the central governing body to serve any other purpose outside of allowing interest free monetary issuance, least the network come to great harm. Many other details of the networks operations remain as open questions. Those are described below.</p>

		<h2>Goal</h2>

		<p>The Favor allows people a simple way to receive goods and services which aren't available to be freely given, and for which they cannot afford or access high cost central bank debt.</p>

		<p>Capitalism, the strictly hierarchical system of monetary issuance and interest securement based on interest baring debt and interest collection for ownership, harms the common people in both growth and recession. But, in recession, the pain felt by those who own the least debt and capital becomes more severe. Money becomes scarce, and — even in environments where resources and talents are abundant — the people's needs go unmet for lack of a basic medium of exchange where trust has been eroded.</p> 

		<p>Those who've had the free-time and good fortune to establish trusting relationships, surpluses of resources, or both endure, while those who have been doing their best within the business-as-usual model are left to suffer, often for having made no greater mistake than doing their best to do what authority figures have told them: "Go to college, work hard, keep your head down, get a good job, dress for success." </p>

		<p>The Favor is an opportunity for people to get some of their needs met outside of the dollar obligated economy. This, in turn, allows people to spend more of their dollars on things that have to be paid for that way: rent, mortgage, utilities, loan servicing.</p> 



		<h2>Key Mechanics</h2>

		<h3>Zero Sum</h3>
		<p>The Favor Solutions Network must always exist at an aggregate balance of zero credits to debits, system wide. It is this interest free debt, zero balance based issuance factor which allows the Favor to increase in circulation when the central bank currency goes into recession.</p> 


		<h3>Network Fees</h3>
		<p>Each party in a transaction pays one percent of the transaction value to the network to cover maintenance costs. </p>

		<span class="type__aside">Example:<br>
		Morgan buys an f100 tent from Chris. Morgan spends f101 and Chris receives f99. The network receives f2. </span>


		<h3>Credit Limits</h3>
		<p>Upon entry into the network, each member is given a credit limit at the discretion of the steering committee. Factors in the committee's decision may include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>default credit minimum</li>
				<li>applicant's requested credit limit</li>
				<li>applicant's referrals</li>
				<li>applicant's previous achievements (portfolio, resume, CV, awards, certifications)</li>
				<li>business plan</li>
			</ul>

		<p>The steering committee will need to determine criterion for the raising of credit limits for extant members. Possible criteria include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>highest past balance</li>
				<li>transaction history</li>
				<li>increase in referrals and testimonials (possible inclusion of a reputation currency in parallel)</li>
			</ul>

		<p>Factors which should probably not be considered for the sake of others in the network:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>race, gender, sex, sexual-orientation</li>
				<li>applicant's need</li>
			</ul>

		<p>Instead of considering degree of need and membership in groups commonly disenfranchised by the business-as-usual world as criterion for a high credit limit, the members of the network are free to support individuals and to encourage the support of individuals for such reasons. </p>

		<p>Considering that a credit limit is just the degree of debt that a member can incur, there is no service being done to extend someone a credit limit beyond their means to contribute. It is a greater service to contribute to furthering their means.</p>

		<p>Importantly, there is no upward balance limit. A member can join, be given a f(-100) credit limit, and carry a balance of f8029. The credit limit is just the limit on how far a member can go into debt.</p>


		<h2>Open Questions</h2>

		<h3>Credit Limits</h3>

		<h3>Governance</h3>

		<h3>Bankruptsy, Death &#36; Account Duplication</h3>

		<h3>Limitations to Scale</h3>

		<h3>Privacy</h3>

		<h3>Taxation</h3>
		<p>The standard practice in barter networks is to collect a w-9 from all members upon admittance. This can limit access in ways which we might not intend. And, as long as the organization keeps records of all transactions using industry standard matter-of-record practices, and makes tax documentation available to all members, it may be able to stay out of trouble with the IRS. This, potentially providing that the organizations cooperates with any investigation which does occur.</p>

		<p>This is not enough of a concern to forestall initiation.</p>

		<p>These questions will need to be addressed with a CPA, though, before the organization can scale to any significant impact.</p>

		<h3>Brokerage Services</h3>
		<p>In order to support the currency, or by request of a member, it may be beneficial for steering committee, an individual member thereof, or a delegated party to broker an arrangement between members. </p>

		<p>In isolation, and in the beginning, this is not a big deal. If it were to occur frequently, the 2% transaction fee would not be nearly sufficient in many cases to compensate for the effort involved. This could lead to a system imbalance. </p>

		<p>The steering committee may elect to offer brokerage as a service, or to seek members to perform this service.</p>



		<h2>Taxonomy</h2>

		<span class="type__taxonomy-title">The Favor Solutions Network</span>
		<p>The full name for the total body of members and the system itself, its mechanics, by-laws, and the brand.</p>

		<span class="type__taxonomy-title">Favor/Favors</span>
		<p>The name of the currency. Favors are denominated by a lowercase 'f' followed by an integer (there is no change equivalent in the Favor banking system): f238, two-hundred-thirty-eight favors. A negative balance is best designated in parentheticals, potentially including a minus mark (or hyphen) to diminish ambiguity: f(452), f(-452). Developing a canonical form would be ideal, though not pressing.</p>
